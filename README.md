## The Basics of Monopoly Go

Monopoly Go is an exciting mobile game that combines elements of traditional Monopoly with modern-day features. Players can collect properties, make trades, and advance through the board using dice rolls, much like in the physical version of the game. One of the major in-game currencies is dice, as they are required to move around the board, purchase properties, and engage with other players.

The daily free dice feature allows players to collect a certain number of dice every day without spending any real money. This is a significant perk that adds to the overall enjoyment of the game. Let's take a closer look at how to maximize this feature and make the most of your daily rewards.

## Why Daily Free Dice Matter

Dice in Monopoly Go are essential for your progression through the game. Without dice, you wonâ€™t be able to move around the board or land on spaces that provide lucrative opportunities. While itâ€™s possible to purchase dice using in-game currency or real money, the daily free dice are a valuable resource that allows players to accumulate them for free.

### Benefits of Daily Free Dice

1. **Increased Gameplay Time**  
   Collecting free dice every day allows you to play longer without needing to buy more dice. This means you can explore the board more thoroughly, land on higher-value properties, and increase your chances of winning.

2. **Progression and Rewards**  
   By using your free dice, you can unlock new areas, acquire properties, and complete missions faster. This directly impacts your progression in the game, helping you level up quicker and earn valuable rewards.

3. **Economical**  
   Relying on free dice instead of buying them with real money can help you save your in-game currency for other useful purchases. This is especially beneficial for players who prefer not to spend money on in-app purchases.

### How to Get Daily Free Dice

There are several ways to collect daily free dice in Monopoly Go. Here are the most common methods:

#### 1. **Daily Login Bonuses**
Monopoly Go rewards players who log in daily with a variety of bonuses, including free dice. The more consecutive days you log in, the better the rewards. This could be a simple 1-die bonus on your first day, but after a week, you might receive several dice at once.

#### 2. **Spin the Dice Wheel**
Another fun way to collect free dice is by spinning the dice wheel. The game offers a wheel that you can spin daily for various rewards, including dice. The more often you spin, the more opportunities you have to collect extra dice.

#### 3. **Complete Missions**
Monopoly Go includes daily and weekly missions that, when completed, reward you with dice. These missions can vary from purchasing properties to landing on certain spaces. Completing them efficiently will maximize your dice collection.

#### 4. **Participate in Special Events**
Periodically, Monopoly Go hosts special events that give players additional chances to earn free dice. These events often come with challenges or tasks, and successful completion could reward you with several dice rolls, helping you progress faster in the game.

### Tips for Maximizing Your Daily Free Dice

To make the most of your daily free dice, here are some tips to keep in mind:

#### 1. **Log in Every Day**
The simplest way to maximize your daily free dice is to make sure you log in every day. This guarantees that you will receive your daily dice bonus and ensures that you donâ€™t miss any rewards for consecutive logins.

#### 2. **Complete All Available Missions**
Focus on completing all of the daily missions to maximize your dice earnings. Even if a mission seems difficult, it is often worth the effort, as the reward will help you in your overall gameplay.

#### 3. **Join Multiplayer and Social Events**
Multiplayer games and social events in Monopoly Go can sometimes offer bonus dice for participation. Take advantage of these events when they appear to earn extra dice and improve your position in the game.

#### 4. **Use Dice Strategically**
While itâ€™s important to collect dice, itâ€™s just as important to use them wisely. Save them for important turns, such as when you are about to land on a high-value property or complete a critical challenge.

#### 5. **Watch Ads for Bonus Dice**
Some players find that watching short advertisements can earn them additional free dice. While this may seem like a small reward, it can add up over time, especially if you're in need of more dice for a long gaming session.

## Updated Strategies for Monopoly Go

In recent updates, Monopoly Go has introduced new features that affect the way players interact with the game. For instance, there are now more opportunities to earn dice through completing challenges, special in-game events, and missions.

These updates have also introduced new ways to spend your dice more effectively, including new properties and new ways to earn rewards.

### Best Strategies for New Players

1. **Focus on Key Properties Early On**  
Early in the game, prioritize properties that offer the highest return on investment. The more value you can get out of your properties, the more dice you'll be able to earn for your next turns.

2. **Upgrade Properties Efficiently**  
Upgrading properties can significantly increase your chances of landing on a high-value space. Use your dice carefully, and upgrade only when you have the resources to fully develop a property.

3. **Manage Your Dice Supply**  
Donâ€™t use all your dice in one sitting. Spread them out to maximize their value. Use them strategically to complete missions and land on important spaces.

## Unused Dice: What to Do When You Have Extra Dice

Sometimes, you may find yourself with extra dice that you donâ€™t need immediately. Here are a few ways to manage unused dice:

1. **Save Them for Special Events**  
If you know that a special event or challenge is coming up, it might be worth saving your unused dice for when they will be most beneficial.

2. **Share Dice with Friends**  
If youâ€™re playing with friends, see if you can trade or share dice to help one another progress in the game.

3. **Donâ€™t Waste Them**  
Itâ€™s important to never waste dice in Monopoly Go. If youâ€™re unsure about what to do with extra dice, wait until you can use them most effectively rather than using them on small, less important moves.
